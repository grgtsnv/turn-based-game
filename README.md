# turn-based-game
A simple console-based turn-based battle simulator. The player fights an enemy mage by choosing to attack or heal each turn. The enemy also randomly chooses between attacking and healing. The game continues until one unitâ€™s HP drops to zero. Uses basic object-oriented programming and randomness for gameplay decisions.
